/**
 * @file    TI/AM67/am67_mailbox.h
 * @brief   OMAP-style mailbox doorbell to the A53, for remoteproc control.
 * @details A single 32-bit word in each direction, nothing more. This is not
 *          an IPC transport: RPMsg would additionally need virtio vrings and
 *          an RSC_VDEV entry in the resource table. The one job here is to
 *          answer the kernel's shutdown request so `remoteproc stop` completes
 *          instead of timing out.
 *
 *          Register layout is the OMAP4/TYPE2 variant, which is what
 *          "ti,am64-mailbox" selects in the Linux omap-mailbox driver
 *          (of_match -> am654_data -> MBOX_INTR_CFG_TYPE2). Base address, FIFO
 *          directions, user index and IRQ number are in board.h with their
 *          provenance.

 * Messages exchanged with the Linux k3_r5_remoteproc driver.
 *
 * These were read out of the running kernel module by disassembly, not from a
 * header, because they exist in no upstream source: mainline's
 * ti_k3_r5_remoteproc.c has no mailbox in its stop path at all, and the OMAP
 * enum (drivers/remoteproc/omap_remoteproc.h) stops at RP_MBOX_END_MSG
 * 0xFFFFFF14.
 *
 * Do NOT substitute 0xFFFFFF11/0xFFFFFF12 here. Those are RP_MBOX_SUSPEND_SYSTEM
 * and RP_MBOX_SUSPEND_ACK; answering them leaves `stop` timing out exactly as
 * before, with nothing to indicate why.
