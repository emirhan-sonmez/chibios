/**
 * @file    TI/AM67/am67_padcfg.h
 * @brief   AM67 (J722S) PADCFG (pinmux) helpers.
 * @details Pad registers are write-protected until BOTH lock regions of the
 *          domain are unlocked, and each lock region has TWO adjacent KICK
 *          registers that both must be written (KICK0 at +0x?008, KICK1 at
 *          +0x?00C). Writing only one register of a pair leaves the lock
 *          closed and pad writes are silently ignored.
